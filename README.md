# Expo CLI Dependency Resolution Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: dependency resolution errors caused by inconsistencies between your `package.json` file and your `node_modules` directory.  This can lead to build failures and runtime errors. The `expoBug.js` file shows a scenario that might trigger the problem, while `expoBugSolution.js` demonstrates how to resolve the issue using the correct approach.

## Problem

Incorrectly installing or managing dependencies can result in a mismatch between the expected dependencies (as listed in `package.json`) and the actual installed dependencies (in `node_modules`). This mismatch can be subtle and difficult to detect, often manifesting as cryptic error messages during the build process.

## Solution

The most reliable solution involves a clean reinstallation of dependencies.  This ensures that the `node_modules` directory accurately reflects the dependencies specified in `package.json`:

1. **Remove `node_modules`:** Delete the `node_modules` folder from your project.
2. **Remove `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`):**  Delete the lock file to ensure a fresh install.
3. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall your dependencies.
4. **Rebuild:**  Try rebuilding or running your Expo project again. This will help determine whether the dependencies are properly installed.

If the problem persists, carefully review your `package.json` file for any conflicting dependencies or incorrect versions. Consider using a consistent package manager (either npm or yarn) throughout your project lifecycle.
