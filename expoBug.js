This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` file and the actual dependencies installed in your project's `node_modules` folder.  This can happen due to various reasons, including corrupted installations, manual modifications to `node_modules`, or inconsistencies caused by using different package managers (npm, yarn).  The error might manifest differently depending on the specific dependency causing the conflict.
